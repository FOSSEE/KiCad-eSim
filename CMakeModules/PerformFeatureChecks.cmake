# Check for platform specific features and generate configuration header..
#
# This cmake file was written to create a platform specific configuration
# header to handle differences between build platforms.  Please add new
# feature checks to this file.  Always check the wxWidgets headers first
# before adding new feature checks.  The wxWidgets build system does a
# very good job of handling platform and compiler differences.
#
# Should you feel the need to do this:
#
# #ifdef SYSTEM_A
# #  include <some_header_for_system_a.h>
# #elif SYSTEM_B
# #  include <some_other_header_for_system_b.h>
# #elif SYSTEM_C
# #  include <yet_another_header_for_system_c.h>
# #endif
#
# in your source, don't.  It is not portable nor is it maintainable.
# Use cmake to detect system specific dependencies and update the
# configuration header instead.
#
# See this link for information on writing cmake system checks:
#
#     http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/CMake_HowToDoPlatformChecks
#
# More importantly see "Recommendations for Writing Autoconf Macros" in:
#
#     http://www.lrde.epita.fr/~adl/dl/autotools.pdf
#
# for an explanation of why you should do this.  Even though this is an
# autotools tutorial.  This section clearly explains why checking for
# features is superior to checking for systems.  The previous section of
# this tutorial shows how to create a system independent check for _mkdir().
# Consider it a benchmark when writing your own feature tests.
