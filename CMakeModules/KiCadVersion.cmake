# Note: unless you are the person responsible for creating releases,
#       do *not* change these variables.  This way the KiCad project
#       can maintain control over what is an official KiCad build and
#       what is not.  Setting these variable that conflict with KiCad
#       releases is a shooting offense.

# This file gets included in the WriteVersionHeader.cmake file to set
# the KiCad version when the source is provided in an archive file.
# When KiCad is cloned using git, the git version is used.  The only
# time this should be set to a value other than "no-vcs-found" is when
# a source archive is created.  This eliminates the need to set
# KICAD_VERSION during the build configuration step.
