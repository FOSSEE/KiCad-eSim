    <h1>Arduino Pro Mini</h1>
    <p>
      This template forms the basis for a board with the same layout as the <a href="https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-pro-mini">Arduino Pro Mini</a>, including the appropriate board outline and header locations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note: this template is <em>not</em> a shield. Rather, it is intended for
      those who want to design a board that has the same footprint as an Arduino
      Pro Mini.
