    <h1>Arduino Nano</h1>
    
    <p>
      This template forms the basis for a board with the same layout as the <a href="https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-nano">Arduino Nano</a>, including the appropriate board outline, header locations, and annotations denoting the location of the USB and ICSP header.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note: this template is <em>not</em> a shield. Rather, it is intended for
      those who want to design a board that has the same footprint as an Arduino
      Nano.
