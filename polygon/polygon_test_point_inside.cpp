/* this algo uses the the Jordan curve theorem to find if a point is inside or outside a polygon:
 * It run a semi-infinite line horizontally (increasing x, fixed y)
 * out from the test point, and count how many edges it crosses.
 * At each crossing, the ray switches between inside and outside.
 * If odd count, the test point is inside the polygon
 * This is called the Jordan curve theorem, or sometimes referred to as the "even-odd" test.
 * Take care to starting and ending points of segments outlines, when the horizontal line crosses a segment outline
 * exactly on an ending point:
 * Because the starting point of a segment is also the ending point of the previous, only one must be used.
 * And we do no use twice the same segment, so we do NOT use both starting and ending points of these 2 segments.
 * So we must use only one ending point of each segment when calculating intersections
 * but it cannot be always the starting or the ending point. This depend on relative position of 2 consectutive segments
 * Here, the ending point above the Y reference position is used
 *   and the ending point below or equal the Y reference position is NOT used
 * Obviously, others cases are irrelevant because there is not intersection.
