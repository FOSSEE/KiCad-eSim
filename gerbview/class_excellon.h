/* coordintes units:
 *  Coordinates are measured either in inch or metric (millimeters).
 *  Inch coordinates are in six digits (00.0000) with increments as small as 0.0001 (1/10,000).
 *  Metric coordinates can be measured in microns (thousandths of a millimeter)
 *  in one of the following three ways:
 *   Five digit 10 micron resolution (000.00)
 *   Six digit 10 micron resolution (0000.00)
 *   Six digit micron resolution (000.000)
 *
 *  Leading and trailing zeros:
 *  Excellon (CNC-7) uses inches in six digits and metric in five or six digits.
 *  The zeros to the left of the coordinate are called leading zeros (LZ).
 *  The zeros to right of the coordinate are called trailing zeros (TZ).
 *  The CNC-7 uses leading zeros unless you specify otherwise through a part program.
 *  You can do so with the INCH/METRIC command.
 *  With leading zeros, the leading zeros must always be included.
 *  Trailing zeros are unneeded and may be left off.
 *  For trailing zeros, the reverse of the above is true.
