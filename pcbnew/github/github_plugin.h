/**
   Class GITHUB_PLUGIN
   implements a portion of pcbnew's PLUGIN interface to provide read only access
   to a github repo consisting of pretty footprints, and optionally provides "Copy On Write"
   support of edited footprints.

   <p>It could have used version 3 of the github.com API documented here:

   <pre>
       http://developer.github.com/v3/
       https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use
   </pre>

   but it does not, since a better technique was discovered. Cleverly this
   plugin simply reads in a zip file of the repo and unzips it from RAM as
   needed. Therefore this "Github" plugin is <b>read only for accessing remote
   pretty libraries at https://github.com.</b>

   <p>The fp-lib-table dialog is entered via menu choice "Preferences | Library
   Tables". For easy options editing in the current row, click on the "Edit
   Options" button. The "Library Path" in the fp-lib-table row for a Github
   library should be set to the full https:// URL.

   <p>For example:

   <pre>
        https://github.com/liftoff-sr/pretty_footprints
   </pre>

   This is typically

   <pre>
        https://github.com/user_name/repo_name
   </pre>
   <p>

   The "Plugin Type" should be set to "Github".

   <p>This plugin also supports "Copy On Write", a.k.a. "COW". Thus a Github
   library may take an optional option called
   <b>allow_pretty_writing_to_this_dir</b>. This option is essentially the
   "Library Path" for a local "KiCad" (pretty) type library which is combined to
   make up the Github library found in the same fp-lib-table row. If the option
   is missing, then the Github library is read only as always. If the option is
   present for a Github library, then any writes to this hybrid library will go
   to the local *.pretty directory. Note that the github.com resident portion of
   this hybrid COW library is always read only, meaning you cannot delete
   anything or modify any footprint at github directly. The aggregate library
   type remains "Github" in your discussions, but it consists of a local R/W
   portion and a remote R/O portion.

   <p>Below is an fp-lib-table entry for the case without option
   <b>allow_pretty_writing_to_this_dir</b>:

    <table>
        <tr>
        <th>Nickname</th><th>Library Path</th><th>Plugin Type</th><th>Options</th><th>Description</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
        <td>github</td><td>https://github.com/liftoff-sr/pretty_footprints</td><td>Github</td>
            <td></td><td>Liftoff's GH footprints</td>
        </tr>
   </table>

   Below is an fp-lib-table entry with the COW option given. Note the use of the environment variable
   ${HOME}, as an example only.  The github.pretty directory is based in ${HOME}/pretty/.  Anytime you
   use option allow_pretty_writing_to_this_dir, you will create that directory manually and it must
   end in extension <b>.pretty</b>.

    <table>
        <tr>
        <th>Nickname</th><th>Library Path</th><th>Plugin Type</th><th>Options</th><th>Description</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>

        <td>github</td><td>https://github.com/liftoff-sr/pretty_footprints</td><td>Github</td>
            <td>allow_pretty_writing_to_this_dir=${HOME}/pretty/github.pretty</td>
            <td>Liftoff's GH footprints</td>
        </tr>
   </table>

   <p>Any footprint loads will always give precedence to the local footprints
   found in the pretty dir given by option
   <b>allow_pretty_writing_to_this_dir</b>. So once you have written to the COW
   library's local directory by doing a footprint save, no github updates will
   be seen when loading a footprint by the same name as one for which you've
   written locally.

   <p>Always keep a separate local *.pretty directory for each Github library,
   never combine them by referring to the same directory more than once. Also,
   do not also use the same COW (*.pretty) directory in a "KiCad" fp-lib-table
   entry. This would likely create a mess. The COW directory should be manually
   created in advance, and the directory name must end with ".pretty". The value
   of the option <b>allow_pretty_writing_to_this_dir</b> will be path
   substituted with any environment variable strings embedded, just like the
   "Library Path" is.

   <p>What's the point of COW? It is to turbo-charge the sharing of footprints.
   If you periodically email your COW pretty footprint modifications to the
   Github repo maintainer, you can help update the Github copy. Simply email the
   individual *.kicad_mod files you find in your COW directories. After you've
   received confirmation that your changes have been committed up at github.com,
   you can safely delete your COW file(s) and those from github.com will flow
   down. Your goal should be to keep the COW file set as small as possible by
   contributing frequently to the shared master copies at https://github.com.

   <p>Note that if you use the module editor to delete a footprint and it is
   present in the COW local dir, it will get deleted from there. However, it may
   not be deleted from the library as a whole if the footprint of the same name
   also exists in the github repo. In this case deleting the local copy will
   simply unmask the one at the github repo. Remember, it is masked out if there
   is a local COW copy, since the local copy always takes precedence. And
   remember you cannot modify the github copy except by emailing a COW
   modification to the repo maintainer.

   <p>If you happen to be the repo maintainer, then the obvious solution for you
   is to make your COW directory <b>be</b> your working copy directory. From
   there you can push to github. And you can receive *.kicad_mod files by email
   and put them into your local working copy directory also and do diffs,
   reverting or denying when appropriate, editing when appropriate before
   pushing or denying the change. Ultimately you would owe the sender either a
   note of acceptance or denial by email.
