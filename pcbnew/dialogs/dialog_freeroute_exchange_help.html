<h1>Freerouter Guidelines:</h1>
<ol>
<li> in pcbnew, using the Layers Setup dialog:</li><br>
 <li>choose the number of layers, and enter the name of each layer.</li><br><br>
    These should look something like this (if a 6 layer board):
<ul>
    <li>Front - signal</li>
    <li>Ground - power</li>
    <li>H1_Signal - signal</li>
    <li>V2_Signal - signal</li>
    <li>Power - power</li>
    <li>Back - signal</li>
</ul><br>
    Notice that after the layer name there is a layer type field, either 'signal' or 'power', typically.
    Any layer identified as 'power' will be removed from the layer menu in Freerouter,
    as this will be assumed to contain a power zone.
</li><br><br>

<li> in pcbnew:  establish board perimeter.</li><br>

<li> in pcbnew: load in the netlist so you have all the components defined and instantiated.</li><br>

<li> in pcbnew: establish any zones, inclusive of net association.</li><br>

<li> in pcbnew: do the degree of component placements you are comfortable with.
     It is a little easier to accurately position components in pcbnew than in
     freerouter, but either will work.</li><br>

<li> in pcbnew: set up the netclasses. Power traces might be a little thicker
     than signal traces. If so, add a netclass called 'power'.
     Make its traces thicker than what you establish for netclass 'Default'.
     Set trace width, spacing and vias for each netclass.</li><br>

<li> in pcbnew: export to DSN.</li><br>

<li> load up freerouter (keep it running for any subsequent iterations of 5) through 16) here).</li><br>

<li> in freerouter: load the project's *.dsn file. Immediately after a load, all
     components and traces (if any) will initially be 'fixed'. This is a 'lock
     in place' toggle that you can undo by selecting a region with your mouse
     and then selecting 'Unfix' from the menu. Occassionally you may want to
     re-fix a trace or a part, if only temporarily. This keeps it locked in
     place.
</li><br>

<li> useful, not mandatory: in freerouter: set your move snap modulus, which seems
     to default to 1 internal unit.
     20 mils in x and in y is about reasonable.</li><br>

<li> in freerouter: finish placing any components, you can change sides of a part
     here also, rotate, whatever.</li><br>

<li> in freerouter: route the board, and save frequently to a *.dsn file while
     routing in case of power loss. Pick the menu option for saving a full *.dsn
     file, not a session file (yet). The full freerouter *.dsn file is a superset
     format, one that can be reloaded in the event of a power loss. Whereas the
     *.ses file is not a complete design, but only with the *.brd file
     constitutes a full design. So it is important to backup your work to a
     *.dsn file while routing in case of power loss.</li><br>

<li> in freerouter: when done, or when you want to back import, then save as a session file, *.ses.</li><br>

<li> in pcbnew: backimport the session file</li><br>

<li> in pcbnew: at this point the zones have to be refilled. One way to do that
     is to simply run DRC.</li>
