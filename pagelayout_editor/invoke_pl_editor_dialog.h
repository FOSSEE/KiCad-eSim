// This header is an insolation layer between top most frames and any number of
// DIALOG classes which can be called from a frame window.
// It is a place to put invocation functions for [modal] dialogs, with benefits:
//
// 1) The information about each dialog class is not exposed to the frame.
//    So therefore the DIALOG class can often be kept out of a header file entirely.
//
// 2) The information about the calling frame is not necessarily exposed to
//    to the called dialog class, at least not in here.

// The actual InvokeDialog<class>() function is usually coded at the bottom of the
// DIALOG_<class>.cpp file.
