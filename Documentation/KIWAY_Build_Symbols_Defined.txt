KIWAY Build Symbols, Definitions and Intentions


COMPILING_DLL:

    This is a signal to import_export.h, and when present, toggles the
    interpretation of the #defines in that file. Its purpose should not be
    extended beyond this.


USE_KIWAY_DLLS:

    Comes from CMake as a user configuration variable, settable in the Cmake
    user interface. It decides if KiCad will be built with the *.kiface program
    modules.


BUILD_KIWAY_DLL:

    Comes from CMake, but at the 2nd tier, not the top tier. By 2nd tier,
    something like pcbnew/CMakeLists.txt, not /CMakeLists.txt is meant. It is
    not a user configuration variable. Instead, the 2nd tier CMakeLists.txt file
    looks at the top level USE_KIWAY_DLLS and decides how the object files under
    the 2nd tier's control will be built. If it decides it wants to march in
    lockstep with USE_KIWAY_DLLS, then this local CMakeLists.txt file may pass a
    defined BUILD_KIWAY_DLL (singular) on the compiler command line to the
    pertinent set of compilation steps under its control.
