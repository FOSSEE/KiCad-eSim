Gnome rules, used in Kicad:

8.3.2. Capitalization

Two styles of capitalization are used in GNOME user interface elements:

Header capitalization
    Capitalize all words in the element, with the following exceptions:
        Articles: a, an, the.
        Conjunctions: and, but, for, not, so, yet ...
        Prepositions of three or fewer letters: at, for, by, in, to ...

Sentence capitalization
    Capitalize the first letter of the first word, and any other words normally capitalized in sentences,
    such as application names.

The following table indicates the capitalization style to use for each type of user interface element.
