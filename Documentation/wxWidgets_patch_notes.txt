Kicad needs wxWidgets, the multi platform G.U.I toolkit.

use *only* wxWidgets
>= 3.0.1 On Windows
>= 3.0.2 on Linux (prevision versions have bugs which crash Kicad)
>= 3.0.2 on OSX (which need patches: see patches/wxwidgets-3.0.0_macosx_xxx)

Known bug on Windows:
Postscript printers print tracks like thin line.
It happens only for PS drivers, and PDF printer.
Other drivers (PCL for instance) work fine,
so it is unlikely a bug inside Kicad/wxWidgets

On 3.0.2 Window version 64 bits:
The mirror mode gives a blank sheet.
This is a bug in wxWidgets 3.0.2
wxWidgets 3.0.2 must be patched (see patches/wxWidgets-3.0.2-msw-dc-orientation-fix.patch) and rebuilt.
