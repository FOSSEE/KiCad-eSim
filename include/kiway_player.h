     * Function OpenProjectFiles
     * is abstract, and opens a project or set of files given by @a aFileList.
     * This is generalized in the direction of worst case.  In a typical case
     * @a aFileList will only hold a single file, like "myboard.kicad_pcb",
     * because any KIWAY_PLAYER is only in one KIWAY and the KIWAY owns the
     * PROJECT.  Therefore opening files from multiple projects into the same
     * KIWAY_PLAYER is precluded.
     * <p>
     * Each derived class should handle this in a way specific to its needs.
     * No filename prompting is done inside here for any file or project.  There should
     * be no need to call this with aFileList which is empty.  However, calling it with
     * a single filename which does not exist should indicate to the implementor
     * that a new session is being started and that the given name is the desired
     * name for the data file at time of save.
     * <p>
     * This function does not support "appending".  Use a different function for that.
     * Any prior project data tree should be cleared before loading the new stuff.
     * <p>
     * Therefore, one of the first things an implementation should do is test for
     * existence of the first file in the list, and if it does not exist, treat
     * it as a new session, possibly with a UI notification to that effect.
     * <p>
     * After loading the window should update its Title as part of this operation.
     * If the KIWAY_PLAYER needs to, it can load the *.pro file as part of this operation.
     * <p>
     * If the KIWAY_PLAYER cannot load any of the file(s) in the list, then it
     * should say why through some GUI interface, and return false.
     *
     * @param aFileList includes files that this frame should open
     *  according to the knowledge in the derived wxFrame.  In almost every case,
     *  the list will have only a single file in it.
     *
     * @param aCtl is a set of bit flags ORed together from the set of KICTL_* \#defined above.
