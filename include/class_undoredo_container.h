 * Undo Redo considerations:
 * Basically we have 3 cases
 *      New item
 *      Deleted item
 *      Modified item
 * there is also a specific case in Eeschema, when wires are modified
 * If an item is modified, a copy of the "old" item parameters value is held.
 * When an item is deleted or added (new item) the pointer points the item, and there is
 * no other copy.
 *  However, because there are some commands that concern a lot of items
 *  and modify them, but modifications are easy to undo/redo,
 *  so a copy of old items is not necessary. They are block command
 *  Move block
 *  Rotate block
 *  Mirror or Flip block
 * and they are undo/redo by the same command
