/*

The KIWAY and KIFACE classes are used to communicate between various process
modules, all residing within a single process. The program modules are either
top level like an *.exe or subsidiary like a *.dll. In much of the documentation
the term DSO is used to refer to the *.dll portions, that is the term used on
linux. But it should be taken to mean DLL on Windows.

<p>These are a couple of reasons why this design was chosen:

<ol>

<li>By using DSOs within a single process, it is not necessary to use IPC.
The DSOs can send wxEvents between themselves using wxEvtHandler interfaces in
a platform independent way.  There can also be function calls from one DSO to
another.</li>

<li>The use of a number of separately linked DSOs closely resembles the original
KiCad program design, consisting of Eeschema and Pcbnew. But it also allows
separate compilation and linking of those two DSOs without a ton of inter-DSO
dependencies and common data structures. Linking smaller, purpose specific DSOs
is thought to be better for maintenance simplicity than a large single link
image. </li>

<li>By keeping the core functionality in DSOs rather than EXE tops, it becomes
possible to re-use the DSOs under different program tops. For example, a DSO
named _pcbnew.so can be used under a C++ top or under a python top. Only one
CMake target must be defined to build either. Whether that is a separate build
or not is not the important thing. Simply having a single CMake target has
advantages. (Each builder person will have his/her own intentions relative to
use of python or not.) Once a DSO is python capable, it can be driven by any
number of python program tops, including demo-ing (automation) and testing
separately.</li>


</ol>
