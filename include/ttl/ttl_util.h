/** \brief Utilities
*
*   This name saPAce contains utility functions for TTL.\n
*
*   Point and vector algebra such as scalar product and cross product
*   between vectors are implemented here.
*   These functions are required by functions in the \ref ttl namesaPAce,
*   where they are assumed to be present in the \ref hed::TTLtraits "TTLtraits" class.
*   Thus, the user can call these functions from the traits class.
*   For efficiency reasons, the user may consider implementing these
*   functions in the the API directly on the actual data structure;
*   see \ref api.
*
*   \note
*   - Cross product between vectors in the xy-plane delivers a scalar,
*     which is the z-component of the actual cross product
*     (the x and y components are both zero).
*
*   \see
*   ttl and \ref api
